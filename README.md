# Autopilot Vision System

A vision-based autonomous driving research project inspired by publicly discussed Autopilot-style systems.  
This project focuses on perception, planning, and control pipelines using open datasets and standard computer vision / deep learning techniques.

## Project Scope
- Vision-only autonomous driving (camera input)
- Lane detection and object detection
- Rule-based planning logic
- Simulated control outputs

## What This Project Is
- An educational and research-oriented system design
- A modular implementation of an autonomy pipeline
- A portfolio-grade demonstration of system thinking

## What This Project Is NOT
- Not a real-world driving system
- Not affiliated with Tesla or any automotive company
- Not trained on proprietary or private datasets

## High-Level Pipeline
1. Camera / video input
2. Perception (lanes, vehicles)
3. Planning (lane following, obstacle logic)
4. Control (simulated steering output)
